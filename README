Polvo is a tool for installing custom modules over file-based systems. The tipical situation (for
which it was developed) is a PHP+MySQL free software that you want to modify, but later you want to
upgrade the software and keep your custom code.

The tool was developed specifically for a group of developers, and so there are some tools (polvo-sync.pl,
polvo-publish.pl, polvo-daemon.pl) that depend on our standards and are not documented. The main tool, the
"polvo" command, is generic though, and just depends on a configuration file described in Polvo manpage
(that in fact describes the Polvo.pm perl library used for polvo).

If you'll use polvo, you should note that it still lacks user-friendly messages and it's not yet
fail safe, in case you have wrong db configuration, patch command not in path and stuff like that,
polvo will fail its routines and next time it runs the modifications will be noted as done. So,
make backups.
